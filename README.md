# bootstrap-project
Started as a simple school project but I got too exited.

## What I've learned (AKA _why this is cool_)
* Used rellax.js to add parallax effect to some things.
* Wrote a JS class to fade in elements.
* Used IntersectionObserver to change navbar style and slide in a floating button.
* Added a background video. _Trendy._
* Bootstrap. Bootstrap. Bootstrap.
